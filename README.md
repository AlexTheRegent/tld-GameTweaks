# Installation
 - [Detailed instuction](https://github.com/WulfMarius/ModComponent/wiki/Installing-a-Mod)
 - Only difference is that you have to unzip archive into mods directory (every mod have configuration .xml file) instead of placing .dll file

# DetectionRange
Change animals detection distance. No more wolves who see/hear/smell you from far distance. 
Or you can make game more challenging and make wolves to start looking for you if you leave your home ;) 
By default does nothing, adjust values in DetectionRange.xml.
You can also change detection range for rabbits, deers, bears, mooses.

# FasterActionRedux
Do all actions way faster (nearly instant). Be careful, you can die in blink of eye, if you choose action that is very long (such as harvesting meat from bear)!
Redux of FasterActionMod by __felipeds__ + fixed fishing. 
This mod can cause visual bug "item message stuck" (very rare and I've probably fixed it, but who knows). Also can cause old bug "stuck with bare hands on pickup" (I've probably fixed it too).  
To avoid bugs you can set action speed (container time works fine) to 0.5 (1.0 will be 100% safe) second in FasterActionRedux.xml. This will protect you from these very rare bugs (which I've probably fixed since I've didn't encounter them in 1h).
I highly recommend you to try this mod despite possible bugs (very, very, very low possible bugs), it's pretty amazing and time saving. I can't play without this mod.

# SkipIntroRedux
Skip disclaimer (autoclick) and intro. Fading removal on main menu is broken, I'll probably fix it later. 
Redux of SkipIntro by __ossian__.
You can configure mod in SkipIntroRedux.xml.

# TweakRabbits
Change duration of stun or kill rabbit instantly if hit with rock.
You can configure mod in TweakRabbits.xml.

# WeaponCrosshair
Show crosshair when zooming with stone (enabled by default), bow (disabled by default), rifle (disabled by default).
