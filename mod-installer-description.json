			"description": "Change time of food prerapation (cooking/burning) or water processing (melting/boiling/drying).\n\nAlso this tweak fixes inconvenience in less than 1kg meat preparation (for example, 1kg and 100g of rabbit is cooking 1h 15min, and this tweak will decrease cooking time based on meat weight, so 100g of rabbit meat will cook 10 times faster).\n\nWarning: it does not change displaying cooking time in cans/pots/etc, but it will change once you start cooking! Important: Adjust values in CookingTweaks.xml!",

			"description": "Do all actions way faster (nearly instant). Be careful, you can die in blink of eye, if you choose action that is very long (such as harvesting meat from bear)!\n\nRedux of FasterActionMod by felipeds + fixed fishing.\n\nThis mod can cause visual bug \"item message stuck\" (very rare and I've probably fixed it, but who knows). This bug will disappear after change of location.\n\nAlso can cause old bug \"stuck with bare hands on pickup\" (I've probably fixed it too). This bug will disappear only after save restart.\n\nTo avoid bugs you can set action speed (container time works fine) to 0.5 (1.0 will be 100% safe) second in FasterActionRedux.xml. This will protect you from these very rare bugs (which I've probably fixed since I've didn't encounter them in 1h).\n\nI highly recommend you to try this mod despite possible bugs (very, very, very low possible bugs), it's pretty amazing and time saving. I can't play without this mod.",
